				<p class="text-intro">Kathmandu to Pokhara to Ghandruk (6,360 ft)</p>
				<p>In November 2017, I (along with eleven other trek mates) trekked to Annapurna Base Camp, to and fro within eight long days. I had been reading about Annapurna for a few years, especially the Annapurna Circuit trek. But considering the multiple factors — time being the primary — I decided to take a relatively shorter trek to Annapurna Base Camp (also known as ABC).</p>
				<p>It turned out to be a long walk but a good long walk. For the first time in my life, I was standing in the formidable aura of an eight-thousander and feeling insignificant to the core.</p>
				<p>This website is an attempt to create a virtual artifact of the trek. It is supposed to serve as an extended sketch of our itinerary: A mapping of where we walked, and a log of places where we stayed.</p>
				<p>The trek started from flying to Kathmandu (from Bangalore) and taking another short flight to Pokhara. Flights to Pokhara deserve a special mention. Mention in terms of how beautiful and scary it was!</p>

				<p>Much to my surprise, I was stunned when I reached Pokhara. A quaint little town which is full of beautiful valley views and lakes. I liked it so much that I ended up coping here with post-trek fatigue for couple days.</p>
				<p>From Pokhara, a bus was waiting for us that would take us to Lower Ghandruk and from there, we hiked  for an hour or two to reach our first tea house in Upper Ghandruk. But, first let me take a moment to share with you what Pokhara looks like:</p>

				<p class="text-intro">Ghandruk (6,360 ft) to Chomrung (7,120 ft)</p>
				<p>First full day trek of the trek.</p>
				<p>There's a sense of excitement in doing things for the first time. There's excitement in walking paths for the first time. There's excitement in knowing people for the first time. But slowly, reality hits in the face and the walk feels like just a walk. With added 15kg weight on the shoulders.</p>
				<p>After 8 hours and a gazillion steps later, we made it to Chomrung (7120ft). Trekking is not as easy as we thought it would be. We realized it 12kms later though. The walk started on a beautiful sunrise note with a view of Machapuchare peak:</p>
				<figure>
					<img class="js-image" data-pos="0.01" src="img/journey/1-7.jpg" data-src="img/journey/1-7.jpg" />
				</figure>
				<p>Throughout the trail, we saw houses. Mountain houses. Houses with views. They had a certain persona. None of the structures tried to be pompous. If the houses had a facade, it served a purpose. Only essentials. Stripped down to bare minimums.</p>

				</figure>
				<p>Every once in a while, we got clear views of Annapurna massif. A temporary relief from the pain of starting the walk. We could easily see where we were  headed. But it was far far away.</p>
